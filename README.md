# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview - Overview of the School District Audit
*The school board believes that there is evidence of academic dishonesty withing their local school district. They believe that some of the test scores have been altered. The school board wants to uphold state-testing standards and have asked for help. Maria has asked me for help and given me the following tasks.

1. Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
2. Repeat the school district analysis as was completed in the module 
3. Write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis

### Deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
- Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis
